# Name:  Real Estate Analysis

The focus of our project was real estate data analysis on 5 hottest selling cities between "2015 - 2022."
-Tampa, Phoenix, Austin, Seattle, San Jose 


The objectives of our project were - 
●	The impacts of Pandemic on Real Estate
●	Finding cities with better investment potential
●	Seasonal changes and Effects

I looked into whether the seasons have any effect on the sale prices of the houses across these 5 cities. I amde comparisons betweem summer and winter sales prices.

We created line graphs and bar graphs to get the overview and spread of our data

Then I did paired t-test to check. The results from the analysis indicate that there statically significant difference in the sale prices of the homes between winter and summer (p = <0.05)
